    <h2>Monoton</h2>

    <p>Monoton was designed by Vernon Adams, a designer who experimented with typeface between 2007 and 2014. During this time, Adams released Monoton, in addition to well-known libre fonts including Oswald, Pacifico, and Oxygen. (<a href=http://https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/monoton">Monoton</a>).
    Monoton is a contemporary take on Prisma, a metalpress font that has a similar retro style. Monoton has a distinctive “Old Hollywood” flair that calls to mind the bright lights and theater district characteristic of big cities.</p>
