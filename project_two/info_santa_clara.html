            <p>Mission Santa Clara de Asís was founded by the Franciscan Order in 1777 and is located in Santa Clara, California.  Father Junipero Serra is accredited for establishing Mission Santa Clara.  It was the eighth mission that was established along the California mission trail.  In 1851, the Franciscan Order gave the Mission to the Jesuits, who then founded Santa Clara College, where the church still stands today.</p>

            <p>Mission Santa Clara de Asís represents what is arguably one of the most important structures in all of California.  From being founded on the Fourth of July, to ending exactly 300 years of Spanish-Mexican settlement in California, Mission San Francisco Solano is a must visit location for any history buff, Christian, or architecture connoiseur.  The Sonoma Mission is also know for being the northernmost mission along the mission trail, and the last of the California missions to be founded.</p>

            <p>Padre José Altimira was busy working on the neighboring Mission San Francisco de Asís in 1820.  San Francisco de Asís was not attracting as many converts as was hoped.  This was a result of the colder climate in San Francisco, in addition to the fact that another mission had been established nearby which provided medical care to many of the Native American converts who had falled seriously ill.</p>
            
            <p>
            Having grown frustrated with the lack of interest in Mission San Francisco de Asís, Padre José Altimira left to build Mission San Francisco Solano.  He chose to build in Sonoma because of the warmer climate, and bigger population, with the understanding that he would be able to convert more people to Catholicism.  Ultimately, Mission San Francisco de Asís and Mission San Gabriel were temporarily closed, and all of the resources were transferred to support the creation of what would become The Sonoma Mission.  After Mission San Francisco Solano was finished being built, work resumed at the other two missions.</p>
            
            <p>The Mission's location across from the military barracks provided the perfect housing for the workers who were building the mission.  It was at this site, that the very first California flag with the famous bear image was raised, as a sign of California's independence from Mexico.  </p>
            
            <p> The church that was built at Mission San Francisco Solano is significantly less ornate than the churches that Padre Altimira had witnessed in Europe.  It includes an image of the eye that has been placed above the altar, which is referred to as "the eye of heaven."  The priests at the mission explained that this strategic positioning allowed God to keep an eye on the church. </p>
            
            <p> The patron saint of Mission San Francisco Solano is Francis Solano, who served as a missionary Peru. A portrait of Francis Solano can be found within the church. </p>
